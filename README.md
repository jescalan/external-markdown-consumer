# External Markdown Consumer

The front-end of [external-markdown-source](https://github.com/jescalan/external-markdown-source). Run `npm i && npm start` to kick it off.

### Remaining Steps

- Parse markdown with MDX instead of marked, with layout-provided default components
- Implement layouts
- Fetching frontmatter only for index pages
- Testing client-side routing
- Clean up and abstract out library code
